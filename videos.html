                <h2>VFX: Chilling sheep on a different planet</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p> The idea of this scene was to create a calm, minimalistic, fantasy environment. 
                    Also the sheep in this video is a tribute to small indie game called "Oh, Flock".
                    All 3D models in the video were made in Blender. Grass was made using VFX graph particle strips with a sine wave controlling force direction (sway effect).
                    The fire effect and small particles were also made using VFX graph. Stars in the background were made with a simple shader. 
                    Lastly, I added small animation and post processing.</p> <br>

                <h2>VFX: Holy Battleground v2</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p> This is a rework of an effect I have made almost a year ago. 
                    For this, I have 3D modeled, in Blender, 2 sword models, 2 cross models and some stone debris & pillars. All of this positioned, timed and modified using VFX and shader graph in Unity.
                    The effect was made out of 5 parts: debris on the ground, swords, crosses, God rays and small particles. On top of that post processing and cinemachine with a shaking effect was added to bring this all up together. </p>

                <h2>VFX: Barrier</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This is a short showcase of a barrier that I made in Unity. The main shape was made in blender.
                    Then it was imported into Unity and with a help of shader graph and Visual Effect graph it received the proper appearance.
                    Lastly, some post processing and simple animation was used to fully showcase it. </p>

                <h2>VFX: Holy voxel spears + Animation</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This initialy started as a simple test animation. I wanted to check if imported voxel model of the
                    knight had properly set pivot point. After some testing and reimporting, I managed to create this
                    simple animation. Afterwards I supplemented it with a very simple VFX made with voxel spears.</p>
